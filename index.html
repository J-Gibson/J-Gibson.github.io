        <div id = abtMe><p>I am Jalal Gibson! I will be a Junior at KIPP Renaissance High School as of the 2019-20 school year, but will also begin dual enrollment with Bard Early College! My academic achievements up until now consist of a straight-A yearly GPA since freshman year, mostly honors classes, and two AP courses (both of which I recieved a 4 in). I am also currently attending pre-programmming classes at  Carnegie Mellon University's Summer Academy for Math and Science program! Here are my coding projects so far: <a href = portfolio.html>PORTFOLIO</a></p></div>
